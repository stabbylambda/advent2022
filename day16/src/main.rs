space by using the distances that we precomputed with the floyd warshall algorithm because we're able to omit visiting
every node that has a valve that's zero. What we'll end up with is a Vec of Paths that we can score after.

It would likely be faster to keep track of the scores on the way back up and omit whole sections that are worse...but I
think this runs Fast Enough (tm). */
